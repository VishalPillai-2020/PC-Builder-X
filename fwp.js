var specs = ["As you're going with a workstation build we went with the best workstation you could get. For the Processor we have the Processor God Threadripper 3990x. 64 cores and 288md cache to choke a horse and Intel's i9 cores(Seriously nobody wants to choke a horse but they do want to choke Intel).As I said it has 64 cores and all of them go upto 4.3ghz and more if you overclock it (yes you can overclock threadripper even if AMD says you can't, watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NQhTQIHs1E). It has 128 threads. This is currently the fastest cpu in the market other EPYC which is for servers. You do need a cooler for Threadripper as it doesn't come with one and those are not enough to cooler Threadripper. It's memory specification is 3200mhz but you can raise it with the motherboard I have selected for this build, you'll also have support for quad channel memory. And it does also require discrete graphics. ", "For the discrete graphis I said above we're going with the king 3090 and it's watercooled(it also has one fan!). We've could have gone with the 6800xt but we didn't find which one was watercooled. As we're trying to get the ultimate Workstation build here you should get two of these watercooled ones and also you should get a nvlink connector specific for the 3000 series. Going to the specs we have 24 gb of  GDDR6X graphics memory to choke Iris Xe Max(Take that Intel. You'll never win). It's got Ray Tracing(Go play your Minecraft), it's got the performance of the Titan Gpus. Ok ok(call from Jensen Huang)it's got DLSS enabled. You can game in 8k(if you can get 8k monitors). Moving to the ports we've got one HDMI 2.1 and three Displayport  1.4a ports.", "We've got the best Threadripper motherboard(unless you're going to call Linus. Don't do that) MSI TRX40 Pro. You won't need to buy a network card cause you have a 10gig card free with the motherboard and it also come with a m.2 expander. It's coming in an Standard ATX form factor. Looking at the I/O It has  Clear CMOS button, flash Bios button, 4 USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A, 3 USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 2x 1 gig lan ports, HD Audio connectors, Optical S/PDIF out and USB 3.2 Gen2x2 20g Type-C. The motherboard comes with some fan, rgb, sata cables. The maximum supported memory size is 256 gb and it is supporting DDR4 ram. Overall it's a great motherboard for Threadripper.", "As AMD does not have any cooler shipped Threadripper with it, so we have chosen the best The Asus Ryujin 360mm cooler. You can go cooler with water cooling but it's complicated and hard (If you're a fan of watercooling you can take a look at this watercooling kit from Corsair https://www.amazon.in/Corsair-Cooling-Reservoir-Radiator-Commander/dp/B08C7NTWND/, I don't know if it has the tubing with the kit). The Ryujin a 360mm radiator and a ginormous cpu block. I comes with 3 120mm fans preinstalled in the radiator.And the cpu block has rgb on it. It also has LiveDash Oled Panel which can show almost anything, but need to have the LiveDash app installed.", "For the case we have The Corsair Crystal 680X RGB. It's a standard ATX form factor case. And it's white so you're going minimalistc!. It's the best case ever. It has space for 4 radiator's but only one of the can go 360mm. It has a Modern front panel I/O. It's got 4 RGB fans preinstalled and you can also change the RGB color preset using the corsair lighting node pro ", "For powering these beasts we have the Corsair AX1600i. It's wattage is 1600!, it's enough to choke a horse(seriously nobody wants to do that). And thi psu is full modular so you won't have those extra cables hanging off your psu. All the cables are included with the psu. And it's also got a self test button (Honestly I don't know what it does.).Overall The Corsair AX1600i is a great match for this build.", "We haven't cheaped out even a little bit when it came to the ram. So I present the HyperX Predator. This beast is rocking at 4000mhz. So this kit is  coming in a 8x2 16gb config, as it's a workstation I might recommend buying 2 of these kit. Because we have threadripper, having the fastest and highest quantitiy of ram may be the best option. I know that 3200mhz is the maximum limit for threadripper but we can overclock it and raise the speed limit.", "We are going to best the default Windows boot time with this SSD . The fastest PCIe 4.0 speeds you'll ever experience, the one and only WD Black SN850. The SN85O is an M.2 NVMe which means that you'll be able to escape limited speeds in SATA. And this is the 2tb one. It has  read speed of 7000MB/s and write speed of 5100MB/s. You may need to buy 2 of these(cause your motherboard has 2 m.2 NVMe slots) which will give 4 Tb of freakin fast storage"];
