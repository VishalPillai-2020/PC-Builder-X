    var specs=["The fastest Ryzen Motherboard the Asus ROG X570-E. He's the fastest and the strongest. The x570-E has 4 ram slots, 2 m.2 NVMe slots, 3 16x PCIe slots, 2 mini PCIe slots and looking at the I/O we have 1 mic in, 1 rear, 1S/PDIF,1 c/sub, 1 line in and 1 line out(Don't feel bad if you don't understand what most of them are I myself don't know what most of them are, i'm just reading it off the amazon product specs and why do they need this much audio jack ports man). And it has 7x usb 3.2 gen2 type-a, 1 usb type-c gen2.","The fastest gaming processor in the market. The one and only Ryzen 9 5950X. He's the fastest processor for gaming , now you might say why not threadripper or Intel's Core i9 10900k. The reason is that Threadripper has  64 cores ansd all of them run at 3.9 ghz speed, it's not a bad thing but the only advantage of threadripper as the fastest processor is it's number of cores but it's only useful for people with worksation as their applications take advantage of more than 1 core at a time but on the other hand games only take advantage 3 or 4 cores at a time and they run more fast according to the clock speeds. The reason for not going Intel's 10900k is because of the one and only reason which one's the fastest and if you look at the specs the 10900k has only 10 cores, 20 threads, 20mb cache, on the other the 5950x has 16 cores , 32 threads and 72 mb cache. Intel's already fallen don't kick them in their death bed. And if you don't believe me watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZBIeM2zE-I (and yes it's Linus who else can explain it to you other than him!)","And for the GPU the graphics power you will never fully yield with any PC, enough cuda cores and graphics memory to choke a horse(Again nobody wants to do that), the GPU King , one and only RTX 3090. And it's an Overclockable edition!. Just saying he's only a king we got a god saved for the last. Let's get to the specs, he is rocking 24gb of GDDR6X. You can run 8K with it (If you get a monitor able to handle 8K on the shelfs of some tech shops, don't ever go looking for a 8K monitor on the internet it's all out and pricey). This 3090 is from asus so you can use GPU Tweak II. Ok ok Nvidia it has DLSS. But it's cheating that is not raw gpu horsepower!. It's a ray tracing enabled GPU so ‚úåüëçüëå. I suggest buying some support stand for it cause it weighs  1kg if you don't want your motherboard to break in half!","For the case we have a CORSAIR one, nothing intersting I'm just gonna copy it off amazon. Just kidding this is the best case in the market, I've never got too excited for a case. It's a white case so you're going minimalistic! You got lots of airflow to freeze a polar bear(Don't search for the idiom on the internet it's made by me). It's got space for a 360mm AIO and we're gonna utilize it(spoiler alert).It has 3 rgb fans and one normal fan preinstalled, no need to buy more fans, all the space is utilized. It says's it's got 3 tempered glass panels(I wonder where's three of them gonna go, it's an expensive case and it's corsair they do unexpected things)","For the ssd we have an AORUS GP-AG42TB Gen4. It's a 2tb ssd. It has a 5gb read speed and 4.4gb write speed. Now you may ask why not the 970 evo plus and the reason is that the 970 evo plus is using PCIe 3.0, and our motherboard is PCIe 4.0. 970 evo plus is compatible with our motherboard but the SSD might become a bottleneck for the cpu. And mainly looking at the performance the 970 evo plus only has 3.5gb read speed and 3.3 write speed, which is lower than The AORUS GP-AG42TB","To power a god and a king we have a 1500 watt powersupply from one and only Corsair (they do unexpected things). Now you might ask why 1500 watts, the answer is that the rtx3090 and The God (I will only unveil the god at the last). Both of them can consume upto 900 watts and more on their own when in full-workload. And the remaining 300 watts or so may not be enough for the CPU ,the Honeybadger , fans in the case etc  and also if you'd overclock the gpus and cpu , It might be Game over for your pc. So going with the Corsair CP-9020057-NA AX1500i Digital ATX 1500 Watt Power Supply would be the best option.","For the ram  we are going with TridentZ from G SKILL (16X2) 32 gig kit. I would suggest buying 4 of them cause it's Ryzen 9  and you wouldn't need a bottleneck from ram(The new Ryzen Cpus are very ram hungry and they get a performance boost when you add more fast ram). If you'd buy 4 of the memory I have listed, you can fit all the ram slots , also you'd get 128 gigs of memory (Threadripper can performe at the best when choking it with ram). It' RGB ram. RGB adds more FPS (That's what Linus said!). And also it is Ryzen optimized memory.","We have no compromises on the Cooling, we have the ASUS Ryujin 360mm Liquid cooled CPU Cooler. For Ryzen 9 5950x we cannot have compromises on cooling. Now you might asking why not water cooling, the answer is water cooling is complicated (unless you have some PC boutiques do it for you) and it's not cheap. So if you're a fan of water cooling here's an option https://www.amazon.in/Corsair-Cooling-Reservoir-Radiator-Commander/dp/B08C7NTWND/, it's a water cooling kit from corsair and reviews say it's good. This AIO's got a LIVEDASH OLED Panel(get your gifs on there) and it's coming preinstalled with 3 120mm Noctua iPPC PWM Fans. And guess what RGB in the house(I meant in cooler)","And now we have internet, so we have gone with 10gbps. If you'd be buying the fastest non-watercooled(except the processor) pc in the world (I am referring to this build itself) you should be having a fiber connection. Even if you don't have one and you have a one gig connection you have 1 gbps ethernet port in your motherboard. So you'd be ready when you'd get an Internet Connection Upgrade ","And because of your budget and remaining 2 PCIe slots there's another thing . Have you ever heard of the Honeybadger from Liqid, if you're a LTT fan  you might have heard about the HoneyBadger. If you haven't heard about it, it's an AIC (short for add in card) in which you can put upto 8 m.2 nvme ssd. The full storage limit is 32tb all ssd's together. I suggest the main ssd I had suggested for this. I really don't know the price of it, but as you're buying the world's fastest non-watercooled pc you might have some more money laying around . And it's freakin fast","Atlast the God. The Red God 6900xt. The 6900xt is the fastest GPU you would get. It's out of stock everywhere but I've got you covered. Featuring  AMD's new RDNA platform and support upto 8k video streaming. It's the best, even Linus said it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUioPsLRKA). It's got 16 gb of graphics memory, lesser than the 3090. Now as always you might say the numbers don't add up and also nvidia is supposed to be faster ,but have you tried seeing it in action. I'm out of words there so much to say but I'm stopping here. This time it's got better support for Machine Learning(Wait for the next AMD gpu lauch their ML architecture will be faster and more supported than CUDA)."];
